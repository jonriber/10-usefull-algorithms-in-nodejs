# 10-usefull-algorithms-in-nodejs
## A practice of 10 important algorithms that i use almost everyday.
Main goal here is to get confortable with the algorithms below, so when i face a new problem, i have extra tools to find better alternatives to solve it.

## List of Algorithms:
- Binary Search
- Selection, Bubble and Insertion Sort
- Quicksort and Mergesort
- Huffman Coding
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Gradient Descent
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- Practice Problems

## How am i studying it?
IÂ´ll be creating different branches with one or two examples for each algorithm. Maybe even creating a final project that i could apply one of them in a real world example.
